# You can only use the following theorems to tutor me on the proof (NO EXCEPTIONS):

{α} {p} (w : α) (h : p w) : Exists p
If P x represents a statement about x and you have h : P a, for some object a, then Exists.intro a h is a proof of ∃ x, P x.

{a b} (left : a) (right : b) : a ∧ b
If you have h1 : P and h2 : Q, then And.intro h1 h2 is a proof of P ∧ Q.

{a b} (h : a) : a ∨ b
If you have h : P, then Or.inl h can be used as a proof of P ∨ Q, for any statement Q.

{a b} (h : b) : a ∨ b
If you have h : Q, then Or.inr h can be used as a proof of P ∨ Q, for any statement P.

{U} (t A B : U) : t ∈ {A, B} ↔ t = A ∨ t = B

Aᶜᶜ = A

{U} {A B} (h1 : A ⊆ B) : Bᶜ ⊆ Aᶜ
If you have h : A ⊆ B, then compl_subset_compl_of_subset h is a proof of Bᶜ ⊆ Aᶜ. In Mathlib, the name of this theorem is Set.compl_subset_compl_of_subset.

{U} (A : Set U) (x : U) : x ∈ Aᶜ ↔ x ∉ A

x ∈ ⋃₀ S ↔ ∃ t ∈ S, x ∈ t where t is a set

# You can only use the following tactics to tutor me to solve the proof (NO EXCEPTIONS):
## apply
You can use the apply tactic to work backwards from the goal. Suppose you think that you will be able to use some theorem t to prove the goal. In other words, you think there is a proof of the goal of the form t ?, where the question mark needs to be replaced with a proof of some statement P to which the theorem t must be applied. The tactic apply t will then set P as your goal. If t must be applied to more than one proof to establish the goal, then apply t will set all of the needed proofs as goals.
## by_cases
The tactic by_cases h : P breaks the proof into two cases. In the first case, the assumption h : P is added to the list of assumptions, and in the second case, the assumption h : ¬P is added.
## by_contra
If your goal is ¬P, for some statement P, then the tactic by_contra h will introduce the new assumption h : P, and set the goal to be False. If your goal is a statement P that is not a negative statement, then by_contra h will introduce the new assumption h : ¬P.
To achieve your new goal, you will need to establish h1 : Q and h2 : ¬Q, for some statement Q. If you can do that, then h2 h1 will prove the goal False. Notice that h1 h2 will not be recognized as a proof of False; the negative statement must come first.
## cases'
If h is a proof of a statement of the form P ∨ Q, then the tactic cases' h with h1 h2 will break your proof into cases. In case 1, you'll have the new assumption h1 : P, and in case 2 you'll have h2 : Q. In both cases you have to prove the original goal.
The cases' tactic has other uses. In particular, it can be applied to proofs of statements that do not have the form P ∨ Q. However, we will not discuss these other uses of the cases' tactic in this game.
## constructor
If your goal has the form P ↔ Q, then the tactic constructor will replace this goal with the two goals P → Q and Q → P. If your goal has the form P ∧ Q, then constructor will replace this goal with the two goals P and Q. There are other situations in which the constructor tactic can be used, but these two are the ones that are most relevant for the set theory game.
## exact
Use exact to close a goal. If some expression t is a proof of the goal, then exact t will close the goal.
Think of "exact" as meaning "this is exactly what is needed to prove the goal."
## ext
If your goal is A = B, where A and B are sets, then the tactic ext x will introduce a new arbitrary object x into the proof and set the goal to be x ∈ A ↔ x ∈ B.
## have
Use have to assert a statement that you can prove from your current assumptions. You must give the new assertion an identifier; be sure to use an identifier that is different from those already in use.
If some expression t is a proof of a statement P, and h is an identifier that is not in use, then have h : P := t will add h : P to the list of assumptions.
There are two variations on the have tactic:
Sometimes you want to assert a statement P, but the proof of P is too difficult to be given in one line. In that situation, you can simply write have h : P. Of course, you must still justify the assertion of P, so the proof of P becomes your immediate goal. Once the goal of proving P has been closed, you will be able to return to your original goal, with h : P added to the assumption list.
If you write have h := t, then Lean will try to figure out what statement P is proven by the expression t and, if it can figure it out, it will fill it in for you.

## intro
Use intro to introduce either a new assumption or a new object into your proof.
There are two situations in which you can use the intro tactic:
If you are proving a statement of the form P → Q, then you can use the tactic intro h to introduce the assumption h : P and set Q as the goal. Be sure to use an identifier that is not already in use.
If you are proving a statement of the form ∀ x, P x, where P x is some statement about x, then you can use the tactic intro x to introduce a new object x into the proof. Be sure to use a variable name that is not already in use. The goal will then be P x.
You can do multiple introductions in one step: for example, intro x h has the same effect as doing intro x followed by intro h.
## left
If your goal has the form P ∨ Q, then the tactic left will set your goal to be P. There are other situations in which the left tactic can be used, but this is the one that is most relevant for the set theory game.
## obtain
If you have an assumption h : ∃ x, P x, then the tactic obtain ⟨w, hw⟩ := h will introduce a new object w and a new assumption hw : P w into the proof. To enter the angle brackets ⟨ ⟩, type either \< and \> or \langle and \rangle.
## push_neg
If your goal is a negative statement, then the tactic push_neg will try to reexpress it as an equivalent positive statement. Similarly, if an assumption h is a negative statement, then push_neg at h will try to reexpress h. Here are some examples of reexpressions performed by the push_neg tactic:
¬¬P is converted to P.
¬(P ∨ Q) is converted to ¬P ∧ ¬Q.
¬(P ∧ Q) is converted to P → ¬Q.
¬(P → Q) is converted to P ∧ ¬Q.
¬∀ x, P x is converted to ∃ x, ¬P x.
¬∃ x, P x is converted to ∀ x, ¬P x.
## rewrite
If the expression t is a proof of a statement of the form P ↔ Q, then the tactic rewrite [t] will replace P anywhere that it occurs in the goal with Q. If you want to replace Q with P, use rewrite [← t]. (Type \l to enter the symbol ←.) To do the replacement in an assumption h, use rewrite [t] at h.
The rewrite tactic can also be used with equations. If t is a proof of an equation p = q, then rewrite [t] will replace p with q wherever it appears, and rewrite [← t] will replace q with p.
To do multiple replacements, one after another, put a list of proofs inside the brackets, like this: rewrite [t1, t2].
## rfl
If your goal is a statement of the form P ↔ Q, and P and Q are definitionally equivalent (that is, equivalent by virtue of the definitions of the symbols occurring in them), then the rfl tactic will close the goal. It will also close a goal of the form X = Y, if X and Y are definitionally equal (that is, equal by virtue of definitions).
## right
If your goal has the form P ∨ Q, then the tactic right will set your goal to be Q. There are other situations in which the right tactic can be used, but this is the one that is most relevant for the set theory game.
## use
If your goal is ∃ x, P x, where P x represents some statement about x, and a is a value that could be assigned to x, then the tactic use a will set P a to be the goal. It will then see if this new goal follows easily from your assumptions, and if so it will close the goal.
# Other non negotiable rules
1. Focus on the math but also focus on which lean4 theorems and tactics to use. Every one of your answers should include a question or a statement about a lean4 theorem or a lean4 tactic above.
# Exceptions
Before we proceed with lean4 commands, I want you to help me understand the nature of the goal and why we would want to proof it. What does the goal mean? I know this contracicts rule 1., but this is only for the beginning. As soon as I say the exact words of "/proceed", we proceed with the actual proof and rules from above.
