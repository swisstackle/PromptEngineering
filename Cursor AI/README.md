These are rules I attach to every Cursor AI prompt so that Cursor understands my prompt correctly, asks me questions and gets me better results:

Key features include:

Better Understanding: Ensures AI fully grasps your requests before coding.

Edge Case Awareness: Encourages consideration of potential issues.

Self-Reflection: AI evaluates its answers for continuous improvement.

Tailored Responses: Guidance suited to your expertise level.

Constructive Feedback: Offers suggestions for refining prompts.

For best results, attach rules to each prompt instead of in settings.
